title: "Rapid Network Adaptation: Learning to Adapt Neural Networks Using Test-Time Feedback"
collection: publications
permalink: 'rapid-network-adaptation/'
excerpt: 'We propose a method for adapting neural networks to distribution shifts at test-time. In contrast to training-time robustness mechanisms that attempt to anticipate and counter the shift, we create a closed-loop system and make use of a test-time feedback signal to adapt a network on the fly. We show that this loop can be effectively implemented using a learning-based function, which realizes an amortized optimizer for the network. This leads to an adaptation method, named Rapid Network Adaptation (RNA), that is notably more flexible and orders of magnitude faster than the baselines. Through a broad set of experiments using various adaptation signals and target tasks, we study the efficiency and flexibility of this method. <a href="https://rapid-network-adaptation.epfl.ch/">[Paper website]</a>'

We propose a method for adapting neural networks to distribution shifts at test-time. In contrast to training-time robustness mechanisms that attempt 
to anticipate and counter the shift, we create a closed-loop system and make use of a test-time feedback signal to adapt a network on the fly. We show 
that this loop can be effectively implemented using a learning-based function, which realizes an amortized optimizer for the network. This leads to an 
adaptation method, named Rapid Network Adaptation (RNA), that is notably more flexible and orders of magnitude faster than the baselines. Through a 
broad set of experiments using various adaptation signals and target tasks, we study the efficiency and flexibility of this method.
