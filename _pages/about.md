Hi, I’m Zahra! I’m a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/">the University of Maryland</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~sfeizi/"><b>Prof. Soheil Feizi</b></a>. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Applied Mathematics from <a href="https://en.sharif.edu/">Sharif University of Technology</a>. 
 I have been fortunate to be a research intern at 
<a href="https://vilab.epfl.ch/">VILAB</a>,
<a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">EPFL</a> supervised by 
<a href="https://vilab.epfl.ch/zamir/"><b>Prof. Amir Zamir</b></a>, 
and a research assistant at 
<a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html">CUHK</a> supervised by 
<a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/farzan-farnia/"><b>Prof. Farzan Farnia</b></a>.
I've also had the great opportunity to be mentored by 
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y6vuiBUAAAAJ&hl=en"><b>Prof. Mohammad Hossein Yassaee</b></a>
and 
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=24GngZYAAAAJ&hl=en"><b>Prof. Sajjad Amini</b></a> throughout my undergraduate studies.


My broad research interests lie in the span of machine learning and deep learning, generative models, and trustworthy AI. 

In my non-academic life, I enjoy photography, playing the Setar, books, good poetry and music. I also love traveling, exploring different places and cultures.
