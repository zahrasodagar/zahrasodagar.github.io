Hi, I’m Zahra! I’m an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/">the University of Maryland</a>, starting in January 2025. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Applied Mathematics from <a href="https://en.sharif.edu/">Sharif University of Technology</a>. 
Throughout my undergraduate studies, I've had the great opportunity to be mentored by 
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y6vuiBUAAAAJ&hl=en"><b>Prof. Mohammad Hossein Yassaee</b></a>
and 
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=24GngZYAAAAJ&hl=en"><b>Prof. Sajjad Amini</b></a>.

I also have been very fortunate to be a research intern at 
<a href="https://vilab.epfl.ch/">VILAB</a>,
<a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">EPFL</a> supervised by 
<a href="https://vilab.epfl.ch/zamir/"><b>Prof. Amir Zamir</b></a>, 
and a research assistant at 
<a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html">CUHK</a> supervised by 
<a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/farzan-farnia/"><b>Prof. Farzan Farnia</b></a>.
For my official university internship, I have recently joined the 
<a href="https://asr-gooyesh.com/en/"><b>Asr Gooyesh Pardaz Company</b></a> and
<a href="https://slpl.ce.sharif.edu/en/">SLPL</a>
led by 
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ebEhWZwAAAAJ&hl=en"><b>Prof. Hossein Sameti</b></a>
to enhance my knowledge of NLP and Language Models.

My broad research interests lie in the span of machine learning and deep learning, generative models, and trustworthy AI, with a particular focus on robustness and generalization.

In my non-academic life, I enjoy photography, reading, playing the Setar, listening to music, hiking, and learning new languages. I also love traveling, exploring different places and cultures.
